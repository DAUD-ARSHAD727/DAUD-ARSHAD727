# Hi there, I'm Daud Arshad! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 17-year-old student from Pakistan, currently in 11th grade at Concordia College. You can call me Daud. I'm passionate about computer science and technology in general. I love diving into the theories behind these amazing machines and exploring how they shape our world.

## About Me

- ðŸŒ± **Learning:** Currently expanding my programming knowledge with CS50, my favorite learning resource. If you havenâ€™t checked it out yet, youâ€™re missing out!
- ðŸ’» **Languages:** So far, I know Python and C. Next month? Who knows! Maybe I'll be able to communicate with my cat using binary.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Goals:** My ultimate ambition is to become a computer scientist and contribute meaningfully to the tech world. Also, creating a robot that does my homework is on my bucket list.
- ðŸ“š **Hobbies:** In my free time, I enjoy learning new languages, playing video games on weekends, reading, and watching anime. Yes, I aspire to be a multilingual, anime-loving, game-winning coder!

## My Favorite Quote

> "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."  
> â€” Eleanor Roosevelt

This quote keeps me motivated, even when my code decides to throw a tantrum.

## Let's Connect!

Feel free to reach out to me if you share similar interests or just want to chat about computer science, technology, or anime. I promise not to talk in binary (unless you want me to).
